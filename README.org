#+TITLE: sl-mode - Stockholm Lokaltrafik realtime info in emacs

Display realtime SL departures in Emacs!

* Configure

  Set the currently selected station to using the ~sl-select-station~
  function. The station is set to a stations name from the
  ~sl-stations~ variable.

  To use this package the minimal configuration needed is an API key
  for the 'SL Realtidsinformation 4' API, which you can get from
  [[https://www.trafiklab.se/api][trafiklab]].

  Setting it can be done with something like:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq sl-api-keys
       '(("SL Realtidsinformation 4" . "0123456789abcdefedcba98765432101"))
  #+end_src

  Keep in mind that your API keys should *not* be shared publicly, you
  should keep them secret.

  To repopulate the station list with station id codes you also need
  an API key for the 'SL HÃ¥llplatser och Linjer 2' API. This should
  not be needed that often though.

* Usage
To view realtime SL departures:
: M-x sl

supported key commands:
|-----+-----------------------------|
| key | function                    |

  This mode is (loosely) based on [[https://github.com/mschuldt/bart-mode][bart-mode]].
